# tic-tac-toe
This is a very simple version of tic-tac-toe

- Draw out the move spaces of the board using a dictionary of blankspaces, then combine the contents of the dictionary with dashes and slashes in a string and print. This gives you a full board
- Randomize the start of the game, and display which player is starting
- Start the game in a loop (there's a check for if a space has already been taken)
